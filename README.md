# mutual-aid

Mutual aid was my award BFA project and winner of the Digital Art & Design award. It was originally shown in the gallary as an interactive art installation, but now resides as a website with minor modifications.

The goal of the project was to create a simulation in which no 'agent' in the simulation was better or worse than any other. Through interaction they create possibilities that none of them could achieve on their own.
